              <h2>GRILLED CHICKEN KEBAB</h2>
              <p>Process: 

                - Give a mix to the marinated chicken pieces to coat the tikkas evenly. 
                - Now take the cubes and skewer them in the skewers, as shown in the video. Skewer 5-6 cubes/tikkas  in each to leave a gap on both sides.

                - Place the skewers side by side (3-4 skewers depending on size of the pan)
                - Grill on medium high heat for 3 mins  and then flip the skewers on the other side. Repeat on the other side for 3 mins on medium high heat. 
                - Baste with the oil on the pan at intervals to grill faster and to make these tender. 
                - Now flip the skewers on the side and grill it for 2-3 mins on medium low heat. Repeat on the other side for another 2-3 mins. 
                - It should take a total of 10-12 mins for the chicken to cook.
                - Serve hot with onion rings and a dash of lemon.
